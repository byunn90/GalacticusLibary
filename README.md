## Description:

This is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save their favorite books to their account.

Users can sign up and log in to their account, search for books, and save or remove books from their list of favorites.
